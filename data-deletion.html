  <h1>Data Deletion Policy for Rovia</h1>
  <p>
    Rovia is committed to ensuring users can delete their data. However, since the app is still in development, no data is being collected at this time.
  </p>
  <p>If you believe weâ€™ve collected your data or want to request deletion, please contact us at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email: <a href="mailto:ssallaj@caelusminds.com">support@caelusminds.com</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once the app starts collecting data, this page will be updated with detailed instructions.</p>
